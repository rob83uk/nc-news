                Privicy Policy, or The Future of Ratkind?
              </h1>
              <p>Written by Richard Dawkins</p>
              <p>
                A world without rodents would be a very different world. It is
                less likely to come to pass than a world dominated by rodents
                and free of people. If nuclear war destroys humanity and most of
                the rest of life, a good bet for survival in the short term, and
                for evolutionary ancestry in the long term, is rats.

                I have a post-Armageddon vision. We and all other large animals
                are gone. Rodents emerge as the ultimate post-human scavengers.
                They gnaw their way through New York, London and Tokyo,
                digesting spilled larders, ghost supermarkets and human corpses
                and turning them into new generations of rats and mice, whose
                racing populations explode out of the cities and into the
                countryside.
              </p>
              <p>
                When all the relics of human profligacy are eaten, populations
                crash again, and the rodents turn on each other, and on the
                cockroaches scavenging with them. In a period of intense
                competition, short generations perhaps with radioactivity
                enhanced mutation-rates boost rapid evolution. With human ships
                and planes gone, islands become islands again, with local
                populations isolated save for occasional lucky raftings: ideal
                conditions for evolutionary divergence. Within 5 million years,
                a whole range of new species replace the ones we know. Herds of
                giant grazing rats are stalked by sabre-toothed predatory rats.
                Given enough time, will a species of intelligent, cultivated
                rats emerge? Will rodent historians and scientists eventually
                organise careful archaeological digs (gnaws?) through the strata
                of our long-compacted cities, and reconstruct the peculiar and
                temporarily tragic circumstances that gave ratkind its big
                break?
